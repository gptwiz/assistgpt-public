**Introduction:**

AssistGPT is a virtual assistant powered by ChatGPT. The app can access screen data to help better understand user context and provide more accurate and contexual assistance. We take user privacy very seriously and are committed to protecting the personal information of our users.

**Data Collection:**

Our app collects the following types of data:

- Screen data: Our app has access to screen data as provided by android to better understand user context and provide more accurate assistance. The screen data is provided to AssistGPT only when the users opt-in to share the screen text with the assistant. On invocation, AssistGPT gets the screen data but it shares the data only when a chat message is submitted. Android doesn't share screen data for the SECURE screen and hence screen data from banking and payments apps are not accessible.

- Personal information: We don't collect and store any personal data apart from the screen data.

**Data Use:**

We share the user's messages in a chat session with ChatGPT along with the user's screen data to understand the context of user requests and provide relevant assistance.

**Data Security:**

The data shared with ChatGPT happens over an encrypted channel.

**User Options:**

Users have the option to disable the screen context sharing with AssistGPT via assistant settings.

**Legal Requirements:**

We comply with all applicable legal requirements related to privacy, data protection, and data security. This includes requirements related to data retention, data subject rights, and data breach notification.

**Policy Updates:**

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices or legal requirements. We will notify users of any material changes to this policy through the app or other means.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy or data practices, please contact us at gptwiz01@gmail.com.
